# xmousepaste
Listens for middle mouse click events and clears the primary X selection (and cut buffers) on detection to avoid accidentially pasting stuff all over the place. Forked from https://codeberg.org/Drogobo/x-disable-middle-click-paste/
## About
No need to disable your precious middle mouse button bindings, no clearing of visual selections nor performance losses because of emptying the primary X clipboard periodically.
With the utilization of XInput and Xlibs this has _no_ measurable impact on performance whatsoever.
No elevated privileges required. Just run within your regular users' X session.
## Installation
### Dependencies
You might need to install the libev, Xlib and X11 Input extension headers.
Debian and derivatives (e.g. Ubuntu):
```
sudo apt-get install libev-dev libx11-dev libxi-dev
```
Fedora:
```
sudo dnf install libev-devel libX11-devel libXi-devel
```
Arch Linux:
```
sudo pacman -S libev libx11 libxfixes libxi
```
### Building
Compile and install:
```
make
sudo make install
```

## Running

Just add `x-disable-middle-click-paste` to your startup script/config.

Note: If you're using any kind of clipboard manager, make sure it does not prevent clearing the PRIMARY selection. By default, Klipper (KDE's stock clipboard manager) *does* prevent this type of clearing. Klipper users, look below for additional instructions.

### KDE Plasma 5.25 and above

In `~/.config/klipperrc` (Klipper's config file), add the following line:
```
NoEmptyClipboard=false
```

### KDE Plasma 5.24 and below

Within Klipper's settings, make sure to disable `Prevent empty clipboard`.

## Known issues

In case of devices which are configured with middle mouse button hold-to-scroll (e.g. Trackpoints), it may happen that the primary selection clear action gets fired too late on older and slower machines.
You can observe the behavior by building with the DEBUG flag set (`make debug`), running `x-disable-middle-click-paste` in a shell and watching the debug output as you long press and hold the mouse buttons.

This is due to the fact that the XI_RawButtonPress event only gets fired _after_ releasing the middle mouse button (in case the user wanted to execute a scroll action).
The only option to work around this is to disable the middle mouse button hold-to-scroll functionality on Trackpoint devices (which is often not desirable).
To do so (using _libinput_):
```
xinput set-prop <device id> 'libinput Button Scrolling Button' 0
```
